### Overview
In this project, exploratory data analysis is applied to a movie industry dataset to provide data-driven insights for a business stakeholder. Microsoft plans to launch a new movie studio but lacks experience in film production. This analysis helps examine movie performances, audience reception, and genre trends across existing films to identify patterns associated with commercial success. The results aim to help Microsoft in decision-making about which types of movies to prioritize producing.

### Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and it wants to get in on the fun. Despite having no prior filmmaking experience, they made the decision to establish a new film studio. You are tasked with exploring which types of films are currently performing best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what types of films to create. 

### Objectives
*  Analyze movie industry data from multiple sources.

* Identify trends in movie performances.

* Determine key factors associated with high-grossing films.

*  Provide data-driven recommendations to Microsoft Studios.

### Key Business Questions
1.  Which movie genres generate the highest and lowest box office revenue?

2.  How does production budget relate to box office performance?

3.  Do movies with higher ratings perform better financially?

4.  What characteristics are common among the highest-grossing films?

5.  Which factors should Microsoft prioritize when deciding what type of films to produce?

6.  Which movie genres are being produced the most?

### Deliverables
*  Cleaned and enriched datasets from four sources(IMDb.title ratings, IMDb.title.basics,movie_gross, Tn.movie_budget).
    
*  Data visualizations illustrating the trend of movie genres, gross, and budget.

*  Features with the strongest positive and negative correlations.

*  A well-documented Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, exploratory data, visualizations, and interpretations.

### Final Goal
To provide Microsoft with data that will help them decide on what types of movies to produce to ensure their studio is both profitable and competitive.
